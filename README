This project, Calculator, was written by Mary Romagnoli
following suggestions and guidelines from the 2010 iOS 
programming class CS193b , from Stanford University (see iTunes U for more info).

It is a fully working calculator and a complete programming example.
The user interface was created using Interface Builder.

The code was written in the Spring of 2011.


This program was designed for an iPhone 3G/3GS.  Upon launch, 
a standard calculator layout is displayed.  The user may
add, delete, multiply and divide.  The user may also store results.
